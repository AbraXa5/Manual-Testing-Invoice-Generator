# Manual-Testing-Invoice-Generator
A project demonstrating manual testing of a Javabased Application

This project is meant to show the usage of JUnit unit testing in Java. To be able to show some "real" examples a kind of dummy application is provided here to have some usecases for the different tests. The dummy application does really nothing, but is serves the baisc functions. Not that this might not be the best design, but I think we often see this in real life. If not, even better and probably easier for unit testing.

Applications and libraries used:
- [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/)
- [JUnit5](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5)

We have performed Integral testing and Junit Unit Testing in the said project, the details of which can be seen in the report

Performed by:-
- [Mehul N. Ingale](https://github.com/AbraXa5)
- [Abhay S. Nikumbh](https://github.com/abhi599)
